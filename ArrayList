-Underlying DS is Resizable array or Growable array
-Duplicates allowed,Insertion order preserved
-heterogeneous elements are allowed
-null insertion possible
-every collection by default implements Serializable and Cloneable interface
-ArrayList and vector class Implements RandomAccess Interface which is marker interface
-can access any element with same speed.ArrayList is best choice if frequent operation is retrieval
-worst choice if frequent operation is insertion or deletion

ArrayList               Vector
Not Thread safe         Thread safe
high perfo              relatively low perfo
non legacy              legacy

-you can synchronize ArrayList by using Collections.synchronizedList() method
